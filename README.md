# ArduMIDI Library v2.1
##### The Better Arduino MIDI Library
It's ridiculous that there are no good MIDI libraries for the Arduino, so I decided to make one. From scratch.
<br>So, I looked up the MIDI protocol documentation and started coding.
<br>This is the result.

## Features:
1. **Sends and receives all types of messages**<br>
Obviously.
2. **Actually fully implements the MIDI standard**<br>
Don't worry, it'll work with that really old synth in the closet.
3. **Direct MIDI data through any serial interface**<br>
Simply specify the serial object when initializing the library.
4. **Follows modern C coding standards**<br>
What is it with Arduino libraries not folowing coding standards?
5. **Built-in error checking and stabilization**<br>
This is a common feature with MIDI implementations.
6. **Space-efficent, clean, and consistant code**<br>
Go ahead, take a look. I even managed to fit everything into two files.

## Installation:
Just copy the `ArduMIDI/ArduMIDI` folder into your `[Sketchbook Location]/libraries`.

## How to use:
**Comming soon...**<br>
For now, just look at the examples.
